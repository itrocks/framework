it.rocks PHP Framework
======================
The RAD Framework for small-to-big PHP Business Applications

# Introducing Alpha version

This is a currently-in-dev version of the framework.

Since a lot of things for a basic use are done, there is a lot of work to do to get it stable and good, and the documentation is actually not done at all.

Documentation will begin seriously once our first urgent app that uses it.rocks is done. Please be patient if you are interested in it.
