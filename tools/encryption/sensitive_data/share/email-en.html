<p>Hello, $user_name,</p>
Your colleague $current_user_name has given you access to <strong>sensitive data</strong>
on <a href="$service">$service</a>.
<p>
	To finalize this access, you need to set your <strong>cipher key</strong>,
	which will be the only way for you to access this data.
</p>
<p>
	You can do this <strong>once you are connected to the software</strong> by following this link:<br>
	<a href="$service/ITRocks/Framework/Tools/Encryption/Sensitive_Data/Cipher_Key?token=$token">$service/ITRocks/Framework/Tools/Encryption/Sensitive_Data/Cipher_Key?token=$token</a>
	or copying it into your browser.
</p>
<p>
	This link is only valid for 24 hours, until $date.
	After this period, you will need to request a new one from your colleague.
</p>
